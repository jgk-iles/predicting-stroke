# Factors Influencing Stroke

A predictive model is trained on a healthcare dataset containing features such
as gender, the presence of heart disease and occupation in order to predict the
likelihood of an individual having a stroke.

The Jupyter Notebook outlining the method of the study is contained in the
[.ipynb file](https://github.com/jgk-iles/predicting-stroke/blob/master/Factors%20Influencing%20Stroke.pdf).
An accompanying report is written in the
[.pdf file](https://github.com/jgk-iles/predicting-stroke/blob/master/Factors%20Influencing%20Stroke.pdf).
